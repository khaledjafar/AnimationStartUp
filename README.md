Course name in Udemy Three.js, React Three Fiber, Drei, React Spring & More

I am learning how to animate in THREEJS.

By calling the requestAnimationFrame that keeps recalling the animate function.

I animated a blue cube that has a MeshbasicMaterial by rotating it on the X asix and Y asix with the speed of the Clock Timer Class 'Clock.getElapsedTime();'

Thanks & regards
